# picop

Minimal password storage CLI written in Python.

## What it does

`picop` stores encrypted passwords in the filesystem as [Fernet tokens](https://github.com/fernet/spec/) with a custom key generated by [scrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt) involving a salt (generated upon init) and a "super password" which is requested every time a password is accessed.

## Dependencies

```
# apt install python3
# pip install cryptography
```

## Installation

If you wish to have `picop` as a command instead of `python3 picop.py`, copy this file somewhere to your PATH and set it as executable:
```
$ cp picop.py /usr/bin/picop
$ chmod 755 /usr/bin/picop
```

## Usage

```bash
# Initialise picop
python3 picop.py init

# Add password under the name "test"
python3 picop.py add -n test

# Get the password under the name "test"
python3 picop.py get -n test

# List stored password names
python3 picop.py list

# Remove the password under the name "test"
python3 picop.py remove -n test
```
